IMPORTANT: Separate from this contest entry is your list of legal charts. Prior to
competing it is your responsibility to ensure your songs are in your Repertory.
{% comment %}
As of now, your Repertory contains the following charts:

{% for repertory in repertories %}
    - {{repertory.title|safe}} [{{repertory.arrangers|safe}}]
{% empty %}
  No Songs in Your Repertory
{% endfor %}
{% endcomment %}
You can delete or add charts to your Repertory at any time, however it is
preferred that your charts are entered no later than 5 days prior to the contest.
IMPORTANT: Every competition song MUST be vouched for by you (as a legal chart)
by adding it to your Barberscore chart repertory prior to your performance.
Any song sung on stage (not in your Repertory) that cannot later be properly
validated by C&J will be cause for post-contest disqualification.
