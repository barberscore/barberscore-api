The {{round}}
results have not yet been announced, but the SA is being sent to you as it may be helpful as you prepare for evals.

Attached to this email is the new-format SA.

Please note that we have modified the SA to provide the following two enhancements:

1) Easier to read: Same basic data with less "clutter" and color-coded categories
2) All recorded scores: Unlike the old SA (which listed competitors "ranked" similar to the OSS),
   the intent of the new SA is to provide a true "scoring analysis". EVERY group is listed in
   score order (to include all groups performing for evaluation score only).

Please help us by offering your feedback to the SCJC Chair on ways the SA can be improved further.

Thank you!
