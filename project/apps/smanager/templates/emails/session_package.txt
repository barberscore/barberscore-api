The {{session}} Session is about to begin!

This is the final list of approved participants, in draw order:

{% for entry in approved_entries %}
{{entry.draw}} - {{entry.group.name|safe}}
{% endfor %}

At this point, any additions you might make to your chart repertory in Barberscore must
also be communicated via email to the Contest Administrators (cc'd on this message). 

Other changes -- including scratches or order-of-appearance requests -- must be made
directly to the Contest Administrators (cc'd on this message).

Have fun and break a leg!
