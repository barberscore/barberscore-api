The {{session.convention|safe}} {{session.get_kind_display}} Session
has now been Packaged!

Packaging the Session represents the official handoff between the DRCJ and the CAs --
the Session Manager (entries, contests, etc.) has been locked and any new changes
must take place in the Round Manager (appearances, outcomes, etc.)
Please be aware however that contestants may still add charts to their repertory in Barberscore.

Attached to this email are the FINAL versions of the DRCJ and Legacy reports. CAs using
the legacy system should discard any older reports since changes may have occured since
your previous download!

CAs - PLEASE NOTE: Since competitors may add charts to their repertory between now and the
start of the contest, you should ALWAYS consult the group's repertory in Barberscore live
during the contest to see if a "missing song title" (in legacy) is actually missing!

If you have any other questions please reach out to David Mills or Chris Buechler.
Otherwise, thank you to the DRCJ and good luck to the CAs!

NOTE: This is not SPAM. Please do not report this email as SPAM.
