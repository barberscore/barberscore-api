Please find below your "Panelist Scoring Analysis" from the
{{panelist.round}}.

This is an additional report format that is oriented towards your scores (as
opposed to the SA, which is oriented for the entire panel).

Here's how to read it:
- It is listed by ALL competitors (to include evaluation/score-only competitors) in total score order.
- Each Song has an average and standard deviation for all Scores across the panel for that Song.
- Each Song also shows your differential (plus or minus) as compared to the average within your category.
- The panel Scores themselves are ordered lowest to highest, as opposed to by judge number.
- For panelists, your specific Score is in BOLD black, while the other panelist's Scores are in white.
- If you are a practice judge, you will see your scores in the additional column on the far right.
- The categories are color-coded: Yellow for Music, Green for Performance, Blue for Singing.

We are excited to try out this new report and are eager to hear your feedback!
Please let David Mills know your thoughts on how it can be improved.

Thank you!
