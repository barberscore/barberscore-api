        <h2>Dinadesa Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>Effective:  11 October 2014</p>

        <h4>About Dinadesa </h4>

        <p>Dinadesa is an online photo curation service. The Dinadesa Service is available at <a href="http://www.dinadesa.com">www.dinadesa.com</a>.  From time to time, Dinadesa may offer the Services on or through other websites, platforms, or services. </p>

        <p>Our mission is to help people spend less time managing their photos and more time enjoying them.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Dinadesa collects, uses, and may in some cases disclose information collected through your use of the Services. This Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into our Terms of Service.  </p>

        <p>If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dinadesa.com">privacy@dinadesa.com</a>. </p>

        <h4>Privacy and Photo Library Access</h4>

        <p>Dinadesa&#39;s core service relies on access to your photo library.  We understand that pictures you take of family and friends can be among the most intimate of your possessions, and we take every possible step to ensure the privacy and security of these pictures.  Your photos will not be used in anyway outside of Dinadesa and you have the ability to remove any pictures from our service or otherwise block and cancel access at any time.  </p>

        <h4>User Information Collection and Use by Dinadesa</h4>

        <p>Dinadesa collects user-submitted information such as your first and last name, email address, and phone number to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the Services. We may use this information to:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>provide better service through aggregate technical data</li>
        <li>support users on an individual basis</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will never share your personal information or content outside of the Dinadesa organization.</p>

        <h4>IP Address and Technical Information</h4>

        <p>Dinadesa logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the website. This data is used to manage the website, track usage, and improve the Services. User IP addresses may be recorded for security and monitoring purposes. </p>

        <h4>Email Addresses and In-Service Communications</h4>

        <p>Dinadesa may use a user’s email address to send updates, a newsletter, or news regarding the Services. Dinadesa does not make email address information available to others except in accordance with this Privacy Policy.   </p>

        <h4>Additional Uses of Information</h4>

        <p>In addition to any other purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, Dinadesa may process personal information collected through your use of the Services for the following purposes:  </p>

        <ul>
        <li>to provide our products and services to users, including the display of customized Content and new services; </li>
        <li>to conduct audits, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect, and improve the Services; </li>
        <li>to ensure the technical functioning of the Services; and </li>
        <li>to develop new services. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Use of Cookies</h4>

        <p>Dinadesa uses cookies to maintain context during visits to the website, enabling a more personalized and enhanced experience for each user. When asked to do so by the user, Dinadesa will also use cookies to remember repeat visitors to our website, enabling automatic login to the website.
        You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set – each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You must enable cookies from Dinadesa to have the best experience using the Services.</p>

        <h4>Links </h4>

        <p>Dinadesa websites may contain links to other websites not controlled by Dinadesa. Dinadesa is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other websites. When linking to another website, a user should read the privacy policy stated on that website. Our Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services. </p>

        <h4>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information</h4>

        <p>Users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account and accessing the account settings feature at <a href="http://dinadesa.com/account">http://dinadesa.com/profile</a> </p>

        <h4>Security</h4>

        <p>Dinadesa user accounts are secured by a nonce-token system. Dinadesa takes precautions to ensure that Member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect user information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to user information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel, service administrators, and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. </p>

        <p>If Dinadesa learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Dinadesa may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the website. Dinadesa may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Dinadesa.com">privacy@Dinadesa.com</a>. </p>

        <p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, Dinadesa cannot ensure that all of your personally-identifiable information and communications will remain private and will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we maintain and make every effort to comply with evolving privacy standards, we do not promise, nor should you expect, that your personally-identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. </p>

        <h4>Sharing and Disclosure of Information Dinadesa Collects</h4>

        <p>Dinadesa will not disclose personally-identifiable information to any third party without the user’s permission in accordance with the Terms or this Privacy Policy unless we believe that disclosure is necessary to</p>

        <ul>
        <li>conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process received by Dinadesa, whether or not a response is required by applicable law;</li>
        <li>enforce the Terms or to protect our rights; or </li>
        <li>protect the safety of members of the public and users of the Service. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dinadesa reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information because of the sale of Dinadesa or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.</p>

        <h4>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h4>

        <p>From time to time we may make changes to our Privacy Policy. Our most current Privacy Policy will always be posted on all of the Services. A user is bound by any minor changes to the Privacy Policy when she or he uses the website after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally-identifiable information in a manner materially less restrictive from that stated at the time of collection, we will seek to obtain your consent through reasonable means which may include posting a notice on the Services for 30 days. </p>
