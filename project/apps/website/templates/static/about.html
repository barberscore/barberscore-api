          <p class='lead'>My name is <a href = "http://www.dbinetti.com">David Binetti</a> and I built this app because I wanted a place where I could track scores and information related to each performer during a contest.</p>
          <p>Most of the hard work was done by Alexander Boltenko (<a href='https://twitter.com/russkibasstampa'>@RusskibassTampa</a>), who sings bass with the <a href='http://www.heraldsofharmony.groupanizer.com/'>Heralds of Harmony</a> in Florida.  He's entered all the data and updates the contest results throughout.  Without him this would be an empty, worthless shell.</p>
          <p><strong>I will not be using or sharing your personal information in any way and I'm not making any money off of this.</strong>  I'm just a barbershopper/geek and thought it would be a cool app.</p>
          <p>Source code for this app can be found <a href = "http://www.github.com/dbinetti/barberscore">here</a>.  If you have any questions or need support open an issue there.</p>
