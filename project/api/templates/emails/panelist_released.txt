Please find below your "Panelist Scoring Analysis" from the
{{panelist.round}}.

This is a new report format that is oriented towards your specific scores (as
opposed to the SA, which is oriented towards the entire Panel.)

Here's how to read it:
- Overall, it is listed by Competitor in scoring order.
- Each Song has an average and standard deviation for all Scores for that Song.
- Each Song has a differential for your category.
- The Official Scores themselves are ordered lowest to highest, as opposed to by judge number.
- Your specific Score is in BOLD; the other panelists' Scores are in white.
- Practice Judges have an additional column to the right with their scores.
- The Categories are color-coded: Yellow for Music, Green for Performance, Blue for Singing.

We are excited to try out this new report and are eager to hear your feedback!
Please let David Mills know your thoughts on how it can be improved.

Thank you!
