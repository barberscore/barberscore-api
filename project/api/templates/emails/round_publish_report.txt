The {{round}}
results are now Published!

Attached to this email is the new-format Scoring Analysis for this round.

Please note that we have modified the format to provide the following two enhancements:
1) Easier to read: Same basic data with less "clutter"; Color-coded categories
2) All recorded scores: Unlike the old SA (which listed competitors "ranked" similar to the OSS),
   the intent of the new SA is to provide a true "scoring analysis". EVERY group is listed in score order
   (to include scored MTs or any groups performing for evaluation score only).
   
{You are encouraged to review the OSS to ascertain contest session and official contest award results}

Please help us by offering your feedback to David Mills on ways the SA can be improved further.

Thank you!
