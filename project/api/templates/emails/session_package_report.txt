The {{session.convention.name|safe}} {{session.get_kind_display}} Session
has now been Packaged!

Packaging the Session represents the official handoff between the DRCJ and the CAs --
the Session Manager (entries, contests, etc.) has been locked and any new changes
must take place in the Round Manager (appearances, outcomes, etc.)

Attached to this email are the FINAL versions of the DRCJ and Legacy reports;
CAs using the legacy system should update to these files since
Group Admins may have made changes to their repertory since the last download!
These are the only files guaranteed to be accurate and up-to-date.

If you have any other questions please reach out to David Mills or Chris Buechler.
Otherwise, thank you to the DRCJ and good luck to the CAs!
