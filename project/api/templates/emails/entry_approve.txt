Now that your submission is APPROVED, you can now only edit your chart repertory.
If you need to make any other changes or have additional requests, you will need
to contact the DRCJ directly (cc'd on this message).

If you wish to withdraw from the contest, go to your Entry and click the red "Withdraw"
button on the bottom of the page. Please note however that if you scratch and then wish
to re-enter, you'll need to contact the DRCJ for approval.

IMPORTANT: Separate from this contest entry is your list of legal charts. Prior to
competing it is your responsibility to ensure your songs are in your Repertory.
As of now, your Repertory contains the following charts:

{% for repertory in repertories %}
    - {{repertory.chart.nomen|safe}}
{% empty %}
  No Songs in Your Repertory
{% endfor %}

You can delete or add charts to your Repertory at any time, however it is
preferred that your charts are entered no later than 5 days prior to the contest.
IMPORTANT: Every competition song MUST be vouched for by you (as a legal chart)
by adding it to your Barberscore chart repertory prior to your performance.
Any song sung on stage (not in your Repertory) that cannot later be properly
validated by C&J will be cause for post-contest disqualification.


NOTE: Please do not mark or flag this email as spam or junk mail, just delete it.
If you are no longer the quartet admin or a Chapter Leader of your chorus, just send
your request to be removed within the BHS Member Center to: customerservice@barbershop.org.
