The {{session}} Session is about to begin!

This is the final list of approved participants, in draw order:

{% for entry in approved_entries %}
{{entry.draw}} - {{entry.group.name|safe}}
{% endfor %}

At this point any changes -- including scratches, order-of-appearance requests,
or repertory song entries -- must be made directly to and approved by the Contest
Administrators (cc'd on this message).

Have fun and break a leg!
