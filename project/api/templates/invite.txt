Barberscore is the new contest manager for the BHS.  We've made some recent
changes to the system and wanted to provide you with some important updates.

If you have already started using Barberscore:
    The biggest change is that per your requests we've added a "Submit" button
    so you can be sure you've officially made your entry.  Please log back in to
    the system, click to your entry, and then click the "Submit" button on the
    bottom of the page to make things official!  See the updated tutorial below
    for more detailed instructions.

If you have yet to use Barberscore:
    We've made an updated tutorial that you can find on the link to this email.
    Take just a minute to read it; it will provide you all the details you need
    to get up and going quickly.


Here is the updated tutorial:

If you experience problems, get stuck, or otherwise need help, please feel free
to email support@barberscore.com or text/call me on my cell phone at 415.713.2126.
We've done our best to make this a simple, stable process but it is still brand
new and we're expecting there to be a few hiccups and we want to help.

That's it for now! Once you're ready to go, get the process started by
going to https://barberscore.com  Please know that Dusty would like all entries
completed by June 1.

Thanks!

Dave
