Your contest entry has been Approved!
You are officially entered for the {{entry.session.nomen}}.

However, prior to competing it is your responsibility to ensure your songs are
in your Repertory. As of now, your Repertory contains the following songs:

{% for repertory in entry.group.repertories.all %}
    - {{repertory.chart.nomen|safe}}
{% empty %}
  No Songs in Your Repertory
{% endfor %}

You can add additional songs to your Repertory at any time from now until the
convention. Remember: every song you sing on stage must be in the Barberscore
system prior to your performance or you risk disqualification.

For choruses, you may make changes to your Participants (the list of those
singing on stage) at any time from now until the convention.

If you have any significant changes (such as you need to scratch, etc.) or have
questions related to your contest entry, please contact the DRCJ(s) of the
contest directly (cc'd on this email.)

If you need additional support or technical assistance, please contact
customerservice@barbershop.org.
