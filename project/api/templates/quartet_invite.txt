As I believe Dusty had mentioned in another email, we're going to be using
our new contest manager (currently called "Barberscore") to register quartets
and choruses for the International Convention.  Here is your formal invitation
to try the new system!

If you experience problems, get stuck, or otherwise need help, please feel free
to text/call me on my cell phone at 415.713.2126.  We've done our best to make
this a simple, stable process but it is still brand new and we're expecting
there to be a few hiccups.  We're here to help.

Currently, you are the only person from your quartet that is able to access
the system.  If you need someone other than yourself to complete the process,
please let us know.  For the purposes of logging in, use the email address
to which this message was sent.

We've also provided some helper material which you can find at the following
links. They are worth reviewing before you get started.  The first is a PDF which
you can read at your own pace (or download/print) and the second is a 20-minute
screencast showing you everything you need to know.

That's it for now! Once you're ready to go, get the process started by
going to https://barberscore.com.

Thanks!

Dave
