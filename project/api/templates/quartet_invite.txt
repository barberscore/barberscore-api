Welcome to our new contest manager (called "Barberscore") used to register quartets and choruses for the International Convention.

We understand that you've provided most of this information already; we've
put that all in the system for you so this process should be as easy as "click
and go".  Still, if you experience problems, get stuck, or otherwise need
help, please feel free to text/call me on my cell phone at 415.713.2126 or
contact support@barberscore.com.  We've  done our best to make this a simple,
stable process but it is still brand new and we're expecting there to be a few
hiccups.  We're here to help.

Any member of your quartet can access the system to make changes so please
coordinate with one another so that you don't collide with each other's work.

To see the process, check out this tutorial.  It includes important
information on how to register and is a quick read.

That's it for now! Once you're ready to go, get the process started by
going to https://barberscore.com.

Thanks!

Dave
