We're writing to let you know that the {{session.convention.name|safe}} {{session.get_kind_display}} Session is now accepting entries.


If you'd like to enter the contest, please visit https://www.barberscore.com/tutorials.
There you'll find helpful materials to guide you through the entry process.  This is new
software that has replaced the old contest manager, so please review the instructional
materials if anything is unclear.

The session will remain open until {{session.convention.close_date|date:"SHORT_DATE_FORMAT" }}.
After that, you'll need approval from the DRCJ to enter the contest.


If you experience any problems or need help then please don't hesitate to reach
out to customerservice@barbershop.org and we'll respond ASAP.

Thanks!
